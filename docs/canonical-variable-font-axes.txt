Canonical Variable Font Axis Definitions
==========================================
Source: Google Fonts Variable Fonts Axis Definitions

Standard Axes (in canonical order):
===================================

ital - Italic
Default: 0, Min: 0, Max: 1, Step: 1
Adjust the style from roman to italic. This can be provided as a continuous range within a single font file, like most axes, or as a toggle between two roman and italic files that form a family as a pair.

opsz - Optical Size  
Default: 14, Min: 5, Max: 1200, Step: 0.1
Adapt the style to specific text sizes. At smaller sizes, letters typically become optimized for more legibility. At larger sizes, optimized for headlines, with more extreme weights and widths. In CSS this axis is activated automatically when it is available.

slnt - Slant
Default: 0, Min: -90, Max: 90, Step: 1
Adjust the style from upright to slanted. Negative values produce right-leaning forms, also known to typographers as an 'oblique' style. Positive values produce left-leaning forms, also called a 'backslanted' or 'reverse oblique' style.

wght - Weight
Default: 400, Min: 1, Max: 1000, Step: 1
Adjust the style from lighter to bolder in typographic color, by varying stroke weights, spacing and kerning, and other aspects of the type. This typically changes overall width, and so may be used in conjunction with Width and Grade axes.

wdth - Width
Default: 100, Min: 25, Max: 200, Step: 0.1
Adjust the style from narrower to wider, by varying the proportions of counters, strokes, spacing and kerning, and other aspects of the type. This typically changes the typographic color in a subtle way, and so may be used in conjunction with Weight and Grade axes.

=================================
